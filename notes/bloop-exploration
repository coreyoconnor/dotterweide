**What is Bloop**
Bloop is a Scala build server developed by the Scala Center. It has three main goals:

1. Compiles, tests and runs Scala code as fast as possible
2. Is an independent and long-lived process reusable by multiple clients
3. Integrates easily with build tools, command-line applications, editors and custom tooling
